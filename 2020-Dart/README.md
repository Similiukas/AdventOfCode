# Advent of Code 2020

To run code, simply just run `main.dart` inside vscode. Just need some extensions and `.vscode` directory configured

## A little note from past me to future me
First year, first challenges, first some random programming language which was kinda cool. Tho coming back next year (2021 as of writing this README), most of the code produces compiling errors due to language being new and evolving constantly. Will I come back and fix those errors? If I'm bored enough, then yes
