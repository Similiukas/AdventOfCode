# Advent of Code 2023

To run code, just simply write `cargo r` while in *2023-Rust* directory

## Little note from me to future me
Didn't think much about what language to choose and quite liked Rust so just want to do more Rust now. Also, will try to finish all the days for the first time so it wouldn't be just Rust again.
